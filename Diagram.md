<H1>Oil Change</H1>

Safety first please make sure your engine is cool and your tools are in proper working condition. Jack up your car or drive onto your ramps. Open hood. Remove oil fill cap. Get appropriate size socket (owners manual will have this info) and remove the oil drain plug. Let oil drain out of engine into oil drain pan. Remove the oil filter, when the oil stops dripping out on its own. Turn engine on for about 10 seconds to let any remaining oil drain out of the engine. Wait a few minutes for all of the oil to drain out. Install the drain plug with the new crush ring and the new oil filter. Fill the engine back up with the appropriate amount of oil (owners manual will have this info). Tighten the oil fill cap. Release jack or back off ramps, and congratulations you have changed your oil! If you donâ€™t know what to do with your old oil (You can dispose of oil at most car part stores!
