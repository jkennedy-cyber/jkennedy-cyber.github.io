<H1>Oil Change</H1>

Safety first please make sure your engine is cool and your tools are in proper working condition. Jack up your car or drive onto your ramps. Get appropriate size socket and remove the oil drain plug. Let oil drain out of engine into oil drain pan. Remove the oil filter and turn engine on for about 10 seconds to let any remaining oil drain out of the engine.
