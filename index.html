                   I am currently enrolled in the Cybersecurity program at Wake Technical Community College.

                <p>
                   This is my first CTI class — CTI-110. It’s an introductory course that covers the basics of coding, web design, and programming.
               </p>
                <p>
                    I am enjoying the program and have been learning a lot about web design, markup tools, databases, and coding.</p>
                <p>Wake Tech has knowledgeable and experienced instructors who make learning fun through creative assignments.</p>
                </p>
                <p>
                   For fun, I enjoy working on small carpentry projects, such as building tables and custom subwoofer boxes for car audio systems.
