                <p>
                   I am currently enrolled in the Cybersecurity program at Wake Technical Community College.

                    This is my first CTI classes.
               </p>
                <p>
                    I am enjoying the program and have been learning a lot about web design, markup tools, databases, and coding. Wake Tech has knowledgeable and experienced instructors who make learning fun through creative assignments.

                    For fun, I like to do small carpentry projects.
